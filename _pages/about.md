![aaai](/images/figureai.png){: .align-right width="245px"}:smile: I am a third-year Master's student at the School of Engineering, [Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech)](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/), majoring in Electronic Science and Technology under the supervision of Professor [Quanying Liu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuqy&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2). My master's research focuses on the study of multi-task representation and rapid adaptation mechanisms based on meta-reinforcement learning. Before this I completed my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at [Henan University](https://www.henu.edu.cn/), where I ranked in the top 3.5% in my major.

🚀️ My current work focuses on improving agents' adaptability and generalization in unknown environments by leveraging meta-reinforcement learning to enable fast reasoning and decision-making. I am generally interested in topics related to meta-reinforcement learning, world model, generative models for reinforcement learning. I am currently applying for a PhD in the field of reinforcement learning and am eager to find like-minded individuals to collaborate with.
