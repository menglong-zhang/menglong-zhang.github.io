:smile: I'm a third year Master's student from School of Engineering, [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/).

üöÄÔ∏è My current work focuses on improving agents' adaptability and generalization in unknown environments by leveraging meta-reinforcement learning to enable fast reasoning and decision-making. I am generally interested in topics related to meta-reinforcement learning, world model, generative models for reinforcement learning.
